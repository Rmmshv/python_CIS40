CIS 40
Unit 8 Assignment
Write a script that plays a simple dice game. The game is played between two players using a six-sided die.
First, Player A rolls the die three times, then Player B rolls the die three times, and finally the dice totals are compared
and a winner is declared. (Hint: use the randint function introduced in Lab 6 - each time you call it, it will generate a new
random number).

To keep a record of the dice rolls, write Player A's rolls into a file called Player_A.txt, with each roll being a separate 
line. Similarly, Player B's rolls will be written into a file called Player_B.txt. Then, each player's dice rolls will be read
from the files, added together, and the winner is determined (Hint: when writing integers to a file, they need to be converted
to strings. Similarly, when you use the values from the file, you must convert them back to int.) Print the results of the game,
identifying the winning player and the score (if there was a tie, print the score).

OPTIONAL CHALLENGES:
If you would like to extend the basic lab, some possible enhancements are listed below.
These are simply for your learning and enjoyment, not for extra credit. You may do any or all of the challenges.

After the game has been played, ask if you would like to play again. If "Y" or "y", play another game. If anything else, quit.
Assuming that multiple games are being played, show the cumulative win/loss record.
Assuming that multiple games are being played, change the rules of the game so that the loser of current game gets an
additional roll. This additional roll is kept, which means that, for example, after 10 games,
Player A might have 9 rolls (3 original rolls plus 6 rolls for having lost 6 games)
and Player B 7 rolls (3 original rolls plus 4 rolls for having lost 4 games).
For each game, show how many rolls each player has.
